      <h2>Reason 3: I love teaching</h2>
      <h4>
        Whether itâ€™s pairing with someone else, or lecturing in a formal setting, I love sharing knowledge. If I can help someone get unstuck, that is a good day for me. It also helps me getter better and sharpen my skills. The best student tends to have zero ego. Those are the types of people I like to work with.
