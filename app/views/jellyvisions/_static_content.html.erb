      <h4><strong>Teaching Assistant at Northwestern (March 2015 - June 2015)</strong></h4>
      <p>
        For the past few months, I have been a teaching assistant for Northwestern's Startup Programming & Management course. I help the students learn Ruby on Rails and assistant them in building their ideas into apps. I hold weekly 1-on-1 office hours to get the students "unstuck" and moving in the right direction on their projects.

      <h4><strong>Starter School (September 2014 - June 2015)</strong></h4>
      <p>
        Holy shit was this a crazy experience. In less than 9 months, I went from no product experience at all to launching my first app. In that time I learned HTML/CSS, front-end frameworks like jQuery and Bootstrap, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, and even version control systems like Git and GitHub. Not to mention all the product development knowledge required to actually launch an app and get users.

      <h4><strong>Other Professional Experiences (Always ongoing)</strong></h4>
      <p>
        As an avid sports fan, and lover of most tech related meetups, I was shocked to find out there was no Chicago Sports-Tech Meetup. So I started one. Our group is now 300+ members strong, and is a great place for people to share ideas in the community
      </p>

        Before learning product development at Starter School, I spent my professional hours in finance. I studied Finance and Economics at Penn State University, and joined Goldman Sachs right out of school. In six years I held multiple roles including Derivative Trade Support, Investment Banking Analyst, and Financial Investment Professional. I still like to nerd out over some financial topics every once in awhile, so if you're ever intersted about these, just ask me!
